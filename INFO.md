## Credits
I'd like to thank my friend Teagan, who recommended to me that I should make the borders curved on
some of the grids for that extra pizzaz. 

## Takeaway
I have learned an awful lot about positioning things on this assignment, and can only look 
forward to learning more. It was challenging, but I was able to make my way through it using
all of the class resources that have been made available to us.

## Future work
I wish to incorporate some of my projects on the website from my Adobe practice. I also would like 
to include a page of important links that relate to me, like different social medias/etc and also
a page with animations.
