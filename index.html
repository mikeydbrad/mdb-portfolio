  This is the index.html page for my portfolio that has a very basic rundown of myself, and what
  some of my accomplishments are. It also showcases a bit of my personality from my styling 
  decisions.

          <p>
            I am a student at the University of Washington, pursuing a major in Communications with a
            minor in Informatics. I have prepared this website to demonstrate some of my abilities, and 
            to practice my web-dev and designing skills.

            Knowledge is power. Information is liberating. Education is the premise of progress, 
            in every society, in every family.

          <h2>My Skills</h2>
        </div>

        <div class="text-box">
          I consider myself to be very proficient in Adobe Creative Cloud, 
          Microsoft Office, and Google Suite.
        </div>

        <div class="text-box">
          I use Photoshop and Illustrator frequently, and have just begun using InDesign and XD.
          I want to get better at these tools so that I can quickly iterate on designs, and make 
          them high-quality (after the low-fidelity stage).

        </div>

        <div class="text-box">
          I use Microsoft Office on an almost-daily basis for mostly personal reasons at the 
          moment. This includes primarily Word and PowerPoint, both mostly for note-taking and 
          other solo school-work. I have begun to learn a little bit about Excel, but could always 
          learn more!
        </div>

        <div class="text-box">
          I use Google Suite for almost every class that involves groupwork - their web products 
          are superb and simplify the collaboration aspect of classes.

        <div class="text-box">
          Some of the hardest classes that I have taken have been from the Computer Science
          department. I have taken the following CS classes:
          <ul>
            <li>CSE 142</li>
            <li>CSE 143</li>
          </ul>
        </div>

        <div class="text-box">
          I have managed to take a multitude of Informatics courses, as I am trying to either 
          minor or potentially double major, if I get in during the next application cycle.
          <ul>
            <li>INFO 200</li>
            <li>INFO 201</li>
            <li>INFO 360</li>
            <li>INFO 386</li>
